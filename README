Learn Ruby on Rails and build a simple application in one week !

The gooal is to build a simple project and task management application.

The app will use:
- Ruby on Rails
- Jquery
- Authlogic (authentication)

The database side if the application is supposed to be DBMS-agnostic (On my local computer i was testing with MySql. 
The hosted version uses PostgreSql).
